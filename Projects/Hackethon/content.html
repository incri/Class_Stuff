        <h1><u><b> Problems and Challenges</b></u></h1>
        <p>The challenge of managing the waste management efficiently and cost effective is a big one. <br> <br>
             In addition, there are other challenges to what to do with the excessive amount of plastic trash, 
             how to encourage people to reduce waste and organize waste properly.</p>
        <p>Most of us can claim to have read up on waste management processes. However, it should come as no surprise that despite our best efforts, the damage has continued, only at a different rate. We have come a long way in efficiently dealing with waste, yet several key problems continue to merge and injure the planet at large.</p>

        <p>The negative effects of improper waste management not only ends in a disgusting view but also affects the overall economy of a country. The state has to spend a lot of money to counter the effects of improper waste management. Moreover, animals depended on the environment also face a great threat due to the oil spills and leaching of chemicals which directly cause soil and water contamination. Burning of any disposed waste and plastic materials results in air and environmental pollution.</p>
            
        <p>Though we all are familiar with common methods of waste management like landfills, incineration, recycling, biological processing or energy conservation; we find ourselves living in a world filled with waste. Renewable energy and recycling took us to newer heights, but the adverse effects of improper waste management continue to plague us.</p>
        <p>
            Air pollution may cause health effects such as respiratory problems, as contaminants are absorbed into the lungs and human tissue. Some air contaminants may also harm animals and humans when they come into contact with the skin. </p>
