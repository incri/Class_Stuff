        <h1><u>Solutions</u></h1>
        <p><b>Landfills-</b> It involves having the waste buried in empty, deserted locations outside the city. Dumped waste is made to undergo compression to enhance the density and make the filling stable. </p>
        <p><b>Incineration-</b>Waste is exposed to high temperatures to trigger combustion and ultimately reduced to ash, gas, and heat energy.This method is useful where land is scarce. Gasification and Pyrolysis methods involve heating waste in a short supply of oxygen at high temperatures inside a pressurized and sealed vessel.</p>
        <p><b>Recycling-</b>Paper, plastic, PVC, and other homogenous products can be recycled to put them use in a new garb. This also rids the environment of non-biodegradable, chemical wastes that significantly disturb the ecological balance.</p>
        <p><b>Biological Processing-</b>Wastes of organic origin are made to undergo biological decomposition and re-used as compost or mulch for agriculture and landscaping. Gas collected is used for electricity generation.</p>
        <p><b>Waste Reduction and Avoidance-</b>The stress is on the increased use of second-hand products, repaired products, and reducing the use of complex disposable items to keep a tab on waste generation in abundance.</p>
