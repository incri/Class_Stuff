File name VolumeConversion is created so we create a class name VolumeConversion inside the class we create a main function. First we created a constant having a data type double then we created variable named litres without assigning ani data.
Other 2 variable are created  word1 and word2 having data type string . Litres variable is assigned with multiplication of variable gallons and GALLON. Then we print our result with our string variable.
