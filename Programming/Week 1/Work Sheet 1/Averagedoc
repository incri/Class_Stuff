File name Average is created so we create a class name Average inside the class we create a main function. Inside our main function we created 4 variable having int data type named as mark1, mark2, mark3, mark4 then we assiged value in those variable 45, 56, 34, 89 repectively.

Then we created a sum variable with int data type adding all the variable (mark1, mark2, mark3, mark4).

Then we created a average variable with int data type adding all the variable (mark1, mark2, mark3, mark4) then dividing it by number of items (4).

then we printed our result.
